      <h1>Why</h1>
      <p>
        E-waste is a growing global challenge that results from the production
        and disposal of electronic devices such as computers, phones, and
        hardware. With the increasing pace of technological advancement, the
        volume of e-waste continues to rise, and the lack of effective
        management has significant environmental consequences. Components in
        e-waste often contain harmful chemicals and metals that can pollute air,
        water, and ecosystems if not properly disposed of. Unfortunately, most
        e-waste ends up in landfills or incinerators, exacerbating the
        environmental impact.
